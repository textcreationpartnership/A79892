            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170517:3"/>there are dangerous rocks, and ſhelves to be avoided, and therefore the greater Art, and Induſtry is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thoſe that are the ſteerſmen. Yet my humble requeſt to you is, that you will be pleaſed to ſpare ſo much time as to peruſe this little Treatiſe: It will diſcover to you one of the muſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rocks, which if not carefully ſhuned will certainly ſplit our ſhip, and endanger all the paſſengers that are imbarked in it. You cannot but be ſenſible of the many Diviſions, and ſubdiviſions that are amongst us; and our Lord Chriſt hath told us in his Word of Truth, <hi>That a Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, Mar. 3.24.</hi> You cannot but ſee what an inundation of Errors, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies is broken in upon us, and truly it is as evident, that <hi>Romes Emiſſaries</hi> are both the Fathers, and Nurſes of moſt of theſe Baſtards, and that which they now hope for, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you is, a <hi>Boundleſs Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of them, that ſo they may live,

You are <hi>Political Shepherds,</hi> and will you not drive away thoſe wolves that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the <hi>Flock?</hi> Magistrates are not only <hi>Cuſtodes,</hi> but <hi>Vindices utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque Tabulae,</hi> and ſhould they not then take care of the Honor, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of God, as well as of their own? Is it not their duty <hi>to take thoſe Foxes that deſtroy the vines of Chriſt?</hi> Can. <hi>2.15.</hi> Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, <hi>That they bear not the ſword in vain, but are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, and Revengers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute wrath upon them that do evil? Rom. 13.4.</hi> And that <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> are evil: The ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes it as clear, when he reckons them up amongſt the <hi>works of the

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, From the members of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who love to fiſh in troubled waters, though all proceed not from the ſame cauſe. For ſome make Rents in the Church through hatred, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did. Some through Ambition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Rule: Thus the <hi>Papacy</hi> increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by great <hi>Schiſms.</hi> Others ſeparate out of ignorance, as the multitude did, <hi>John</hi> 7.43, 52.

               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The true ground of all Love, and Peace, of all Concord &amp; Agreement, can only be upon a motive of Godlineſs and Honeſty. Only good men can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love one another, becauſe the motive of it is the Image of God, and the cauſe of it Gods Command, and the end of it to do good, temporal and ſpiritual, one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170517:18"/>to another. Hence its called, <hi>Love in Faith,</hi> Tit. 3.15. <hi>And in the Spirit,</hi> Col. 1.8. Therefore if Gods people quarrel one with another, it ſhews that their love was not, becauſe they were godly, but for other ends: And as for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the very Heathen could ſay, <hi>Amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia niſi inter bonos eſſe non poteſt,</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can only be upon grounds of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Honeſty: Therefore if you ſee men to agree upon evil grounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others are like themſelves, or for matter of profit, or pleaſure, here is no ſure concord. <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree, unleſs it be againſt Chriſt. Wicked men never agree long together, except it be to oppoſe Godlineſs.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> In general: The bitter, poiſonous fountain of corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every man. Man by nature is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a Toad; He can ſpit nothing but venom. He is a Bramble that tears every one that comes near him: Strife and Contentions are the <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.20. <hi>They come from the luſts in our members,</hi> Jam. 4.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The particular luſts whence they proceed, Are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pride. <hi>Where Pride is, there is Contention,</hi> Prov. 13.10. A proud man cannot but ſtrive, as fire cannot but ſet all on a flame. All our Diviſions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publique or private, come from Pride. Every man would have his Will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170517:19"/>to be done, whereas lowlineſs of mind keeps all in peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ambition, and vain-glory, which comes near to Pride. When men are ambitious for earthly Power, or High places in the Church: This makes many quarrels. As did <hi>Abſolons</hi> ambition for the Kingdom. This like a great <hi>Whale</hi> Toon ſwallows up all the good, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Malicious froward Diſpoſitions: Some are of ſuch turbulent natures, that they cannot be quiet but in diſturbing others: and have not only their tongues, but their hearts <hi>ſet on fire by hell,</hi> Jam. 3.6. Theſe are dangerous perſons in a Kingdom; For they do to it, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil did to the poſſeſſed body, ſometimes throw it into the water; ſometimes into the fire: ſo they are alſo in Cities and Families. If Peace-makers are bleſſed, then ſtrife-makers are curſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Covetous and ſinfull love to the things of the world: As its ſaid, Thoſe two Pronouns, <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> make all the ſtrife in the world. An unjuſt deſire to have more then our own, or luſting after other mens, or diſcontent with our own preſent condition, fills the world with ſtrife.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:170517:20"/>
               <p n="5">5. Impatience, when we cannot with godly wiſdom and patience paſs by wrongs and injuries. The Scripture bids us <hi>To requite evil with good:</hi> and if one <hi>ſtrike us on one cheek, to turn the other,</hi> Luke 6.29. <hi>And to prya for thoſe that perſecute us,</hi> Luke 6.27,28. <label type="milestone">

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170517:22"/>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Eccleſiaſtical, and they are of two ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When different Doctrines and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions are maintained; and theſe are called <hi>Hereſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When there is a ſoundneſs of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet men break the bonds of love, and live in malice and uncharitableneſs, and this is called <hi>Schiſm:</hi> Both theſe are very dangerous.

               <p>Thirdly, Diviſions are either perſonal between godly men particularly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thus <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We read that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> were at great variance, though both Orthodox.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, When men promote any falſe, or wicked way againſt Truth and Godlineſs. All parties uſe to brand one another with Diviſion and Faction, the Papiſts call the Proteſtants <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and ſay, the leaving of their Church that had ſuch Antiquity and Univerſality was a <hi>Schiſm:</hi> the <hi>Metrapolitan</hi> makes all thoſe guilty of Schiſm, whether Biſhops or Presbyters that recede from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, as appears by a late Book <hi>(Hammond of Schiſm)</hi> But it is not the branding of any with this name, that makes the thing ſo. If <hi>Elijah,</hi> and ſome few with him will not bow the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> its no ſinful <hi>Schiſm,</hi> or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170517:23"/>Diviſion. When <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> like a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge overflowed the Church, the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox had their private and ſecret meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not daring to communicate in the publick worſhip with the <hi>Arians,</hi> yet were they not <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> If Gods people come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from her uncleanneſs, this is not <hi>Schiſm,</hi> but a duty commanded by God; therefore before we charge any with the crime of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> we muſt look to the cauſe, and the matter, who hath the truth and Gods cauſe, otherwiſe we may judge unjuſtly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Diviſion is ſeen, when though the matter be true and good they ſtrive for, yet they do it not in a good orderly way. <hi>He that ſtrives is not crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs he ſtrive lawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lly,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.5. A good intention, even in a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without good order, is not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. The Diſciples that would <hi>have fire come down from Heaven,</hi> knew not what ſpirit they were of. <hi>Uzzahs</hi> dreadfull puniſhment for touching the Ark, ſhould make us look, not only to the Duty, but to the order of it. <hi>We muſt not do evil that good may come of it,</hi> Rom. 3.8. The damnation of ſuch is juſt.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170517:23"/>
               <p>Thirdly, A third thing in Diviſion is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when men do not keep in their proper places and offices. If the foot will be the eye, or the hand the head, this is monſtrous. St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches every member in the body to keep to its own office and calling: And, Oh! that our times would learn this leſſon, we ſhould not have ſuch wofull confuſions in Church and State as of late we have had: what a bleſſed Unity and comely Order would Church and State be in, if every member would do his proper work. What have private men to do in a Pulpit? What have ſouldiers to do in conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Civil Government, or Governors? Where is their Warrant? How will they anſwer it to God or man? They are commanded to <hi>offer violence to no man, and to be content with their wages,</hi> Luke 3.14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Ist Diviſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and Faction when the paſſions of men are ſowred, and imbittered with any carnal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers: This ſin firſt affects the heart, and then breaks out into action. Though men be in a good way, and are for the Truth, and Glory of God, yet if they do it in paſſion, and with a froward heart, here is a ſinful Diviſion: Gods
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170517:24"/>Righteouſneſs and Truth needs not our paſſions.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, From mens ignorance: for ſo long as we know but in part, there will be different opinions, and difference in opinions, breeds difference in affections. Ignorant perſons like Children are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeduced, and run into ways of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> From ſelf-confidence and Arrogancy: When men think they have better abilities, and more worth in them then indeed they have: This makes them bold, and diſturbers of the Churches peace: as we ſee in <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> Num. 16.3. They thought there was as much in every perſon, as in the Prieſts that God had ſet apart for that Office: <hi>All the Congregation is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> commands us, not to <hi>mind high things,</hi> Rom. 12.16. which are above our place or capacity: So was it with <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 131.1. Hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>If any think that he knows any thing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> From worldly hopes and deſires of advantage. Earthly gain made <hi>Judas</hi> make ſuch a ſad breach. Men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170517:24"/>that judge <hi>gain to be godlineſs, ſoon make ſhipwrack of faith, and a good conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.5. Many of the Arch-Hereticks formerly made thoſe Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they miſſed of that worldly Pomp and greatneſs which they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Sometimes it proceeds from the Tyranny and ſcandalous lives of Church-Officers.

               <p>Secondly, It much grieves, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettles the hearts even of the godly themſelves; they know not what to pitch upon whilſt one godly Miniſter ſaith, its a ſin; others, that it is no ſin: This cannot but exceedingly perplex tender Conſciences, that would not ſin for a world.</p>

For whereas Miniſters ſhould encourage godlineſs, and decry and reprove ſin, they buſie themſelves in preaching up their opinions, and promoting their particular way, which edifieth not.

                  </label> Becauſe all things in Religion are reduced to one: If therefore every thing in Religion tend to Unity, why ſhould not the people of God embrace it? the ſeveral unities are made a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table argument to this purpoſe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. where the Apoſtle having exhorted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170517:26"/>Chriſtians <hi>to walk worthy of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> he inſtanceth in ſuch graces as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure unity, as <hi>lowlineſs, meekneſs, and forbearing one another;</hi> the end of which graces is ſet down, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace:</hi> then <hi>verſe</hi> 4. he ſhews the Reaſon why there ſhould be ſuch Unity; <hi>there is one body:</hi> Chriſt hath not many bodies: All the people of God are one body, and its very deſtructive when one member of the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires againſt the welfare of another. Again, <hi>There is one Spirit:</hi> there is but one ſpirit that enlightens, and ſanctifies the whole Church of God; why then ſhould there be ſo many wayes, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; yet all pretended to be of the ſame ſpirit. <hi>Indeed there are diverſity of gifts, and operations, yet the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> But he doth not ſay, Contrarieties, and the ſame ſpirit; for that is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Again, <hi>There is one hope of our Calling:</hi> we are called to one inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there is but one Heaven: why therefore ſhould we be ſo different by the way, when one place of glory muſt hold all; and if one Church cannot now contain us, how ſhall we think that one heaven will? Again, <hi>There is one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170517:26"/>Lord,</hi> i.e. Chriſt, who is to be ſerved by us. Indeed if there were many Lords; as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſet up many Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all which have their peculiar wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then no wonder if there were ſeveral faiths, and worſhips; But the Lord Chriſt is one; he is not divided. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. If Chriſt be not divided, there ſhould be no diviſion in the Church. Again, <hi>There is one Faith,</hi> i.e. One Syſteme of Doctrine to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: Though there be many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, yet they make up one entire truth; Indeed, there be many called Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and called Churches, but in truth, there is but one true Church. Again, <hi>There is one Baptiſm,</hi> i.e. one Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine of faith: ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper is made an Argument of Unity. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. The Sacraments manifeſt one body, one Spirit: why then are there ſo many Rents and Diviſions about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which yet are the bodies, and ſeals of Unity, and Communion? Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>There is one God, and Father of all,</hi> therefore we ought to be at Unity. God being but one, cannot be divided in himſelf; he cannot command things to be done, or believed contrary to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170517:27"/>himſelf: upon all theſe conſiderations we ſhould endeavour after Unity. I might add, that there is Unity in hell, all the Devils agree againſt the Church: If there be Unity againſt us, ſhall there not be Unity amongſt us?</p>

Hence Chriſt ſaid, <hi>That he came to ſend fire, and a ſword in the earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. which is not from the nature of Chriſts Doctrine, which is the Goſpel of <hi>Peace,</hi> but from the corrupt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Subject, as the Sun of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends ſoar eies, ſo then the godly, and the wicked can have no unity, <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 29.27.</p>

Its no marvel though even amongſt thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo highly to Chriſt there be ſad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions: for many of them are in the fleſh ſtill, and ſavour not experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the things of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>There are falſe Prophets;</hi> and why? becauſe they are <hi>men of corrupt minds,</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> &amp;c. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. <hi>There muſt be Hereſies,</hi> that ſuch as are ſound may be eſteemed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> There is a Unity in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, or Eſſentials, and a Unity in Circumſtantials, or leſs Principals: Now Gods Children, though in many things they have not attained the ſame mind and judgement, yet they all agree in thoſe things which are neceſſary to ſalvation, and this is called <hi>All truth,</hi> John 16.13. and the <hi>Unction that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all things,</hi> 1 John 2.20.

               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Even in acceſſaries, and leſs Principals their Unity ſhall be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in heaven: then all the godly will lay aſide all their bitterneſs one againſt another.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God hath not given his Spirit in full meaſure to his Church in this life, therefore they know but in part; they love but in part: now all Diviſions ariſe from ignorance in the mind, and corruption in the heart, as long therefore as there be ſuch relicts, there will be Diviſions.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The Devil here puts forth his Power, and his work is to fill the Church with Diviſions, and to raiſe up Inſtruments to foment the ſame; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo long as the Devil dies not, though ſome of his Incendiaries die, he will ſtill be thruſting in his cloven foot, where God raiſeth up any Church.</p>

                  </label> There are two Remedies ſuggeſted, but they are both in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The <hi>Popiſh party,</hi> ſay, that the way to prevent Diviſion, is a rigid, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170517:28"/>imperious commanding of uniformity in every <hi>punctilio;</hi> ſo that no diſſent ſhall be allowed to a man, though humble, and peaceable, and earneſtly deſiring to finde out the truth. Thus <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> made a great rent in the Church about the time of keeping <hi>Eaſter,</hi> whom <hi>Iraeneus</hi> gravely oppoſed. Its true, the leaſt truth of Chriſt is precious, and we are not to deny it, yet may we not violently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude it, except the contrary be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.17. If <hi>new wine be put into old bottles, the bottles will break:</hi> So whileſt men impoſe opinions, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of leſſe conſequence, upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not prepared, inſtead of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unity, they make factions: yet this way hath much infeſted the Church when ſome have been in power: they have preſſed unity, not ſo much out of love to Chriſt, as to keep up their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. <hi>Aut ſubſcribe, aut diſcede,</hi> was a ſpeech of old in the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is another falſe way of unity, quite contrary to this, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and that is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, and unbounded toleration of all damnable Hereſies, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170517:29"/>as the moſt probable way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Chriſtian Religion: and as the former was maintained by thoſe that had power in their hands, ſo hath this by the oppreſſed party: But the Scripture preſcribes a middle way between theſe two. For, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 6. the Angels of the Churches are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for not tollerating, nor bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch as taught falſe doctrines, and ſuch as did ſuffer them are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 15, 20. and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their Epiſtles do oppoſe falſe doctrines, and falſe Teachers with as much earneſtneſſe, as falſe, and corrupt practices, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 20. <hi>Paul</hi> delivered up to Satan <hi>Hymenaeus, and Alexander</hi> for their blaſphemies and falſe doctrines: and commands, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. that we ſhould <hi>reject an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick after the firſt and ſecond admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Whence its clear, that Church-cenſures ſhould be inflicted upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate offenders in this kinde. This unbounded tolleration the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> themſelves, who yet cried up a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of prophecying as their great <hi>Diana,</hi> did condemn, and profeſſed that it was better living <hi>ubi nulla licent,</hi> then <hi>ubi omnia:</hi> where there was no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170517:29"/>latitude, then where all things were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; this licentiouſneſſe then doth not heal but encreaſe breaches: for it gives way to mens corruptions to vent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  </label> As the breach of unity may be made three wayes. 1. Of the true doctrine by hereſie. 2. Of godly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by Schiſme. 3. Of Chriſtian love, by contentions in outward matters; ſo there are peculiar remedies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to each: As firſt for matters of Doctrine, theſe are uniting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo farre as there is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in judgement, we ſhould cloſe heartily, and embrace one another in that: Its a mercy that the difference is not in fundamentals: Seeing therefore we agree in theſe, let that unity be nouriſhed, and it will be a meanes to produce further union. So, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>wherein we have attained let us walk by the ſame rule, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let private Chriſtians highly eſteeme, and ſubmit to thoſe godly and faithful Paſtors, that God ſets hath over them. When men will not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170517:30"/>own thoſe officers whom God hath ſet over them, then theſe runne into by paths. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12, 13. One end of the Miniſtry is to keep men from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>carried about as children, &amp;c.</hi> the other for our ſpiritual edification, <hi>till we all come in the unity of faith, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> get a pitiful and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate ſpirit to thoſe that go aſtray: Indeed we muſt be zealous in the things of God: but it muſt be mixed with pity. <hi>Of ſome have compaſſion making a difference,</hi> Jude 22. Conſider how prone we are to receive error for truth, and that we ſtand by Gods ſtrength, this will move us to pity others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> we muſt candidly, and truly report the opinions of others that diſſent from us. Nothing hath made the rents in the Church greater then a malevolent perverting the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, when we make them to hold ſuch monſtruous things as with all their hearts they do deteſt. How oft was Chriſt and his Apoſtles traduced for preaching ſuch things as they never taught, which proceeded from the malice of thoſe who laboured to make them odious, and to bring them into
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170517:30"/>danger. Thus the <hi>Papiſts</hi> repreſent the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as if they were the greateſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> that ever were: The end of ſuch is not to bring diſſenters to the knowledge of the truth, but to diſgrace and defame them; therefore its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in all diſputations to ſtate the controverſie aright, without which, men may write volumes, and bring multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of arguments, and all to no purpoſe. To know therefore the true and proper diſtance is the beſt, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way at laſt to unity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> we muſt not impoſe ſuch concluſions and inferences upon the Doctrines maintained by Deſſenters, that are not the proper and genuine effects thereof. To caſt that upon them for their Doctrine, which is but our owne inference, is not fair, eſpecially when they do with their ſoul abhor ſuch concluſions. Becauſe the Apoſtle had taught <hi>where ſinne abounded, there grace abounded much more,</hi> ſome wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons forced this conſequence upon the Apoſtles doctrine: <hi>Let us ſinne that grace may abound,</hi> Rom. 6.1. Thus the <hi>Papiſts</hi> charge this hideous calumny, &amp; conſequence upon the Doctrine of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that <hi>God is the Author of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170517:31"/>ſinne:</hi> whereas we uſe but the words and expreſſions of the Scripture. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what is the evident and plaine conſequence of a doctrine, that is to be accounted of as the doctrine it ſelf: As whatſoever is a clear genuine conſequence from Scripture is Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but not every conſequence that we are apt to deduce.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> whatſoever truth God may make known to us, or if in our perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only, we are to be very careful how we publiſh it. This hath always kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled great fires in the Church of God: when men have either, or in perſwaſion only, ſome doctrine different from the current way of the Church at that time. Now its a very hard thing thus to be with child, as it were, and not to be in pain till we have delivered it to the world. But ſuch qualifications as theſe are neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhould in ſuch caſes queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and examine our own ſpirits, and not preſently believe our own hearts; we ſhould have modeſt doubtings of our own ignorance, and proneneſſe to erre in every thing that we are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of: So we ſee in <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.12, 25, 26, 40. Whereſoever the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170517:31"/>of God leads into all truth, there he doth likewiſe into all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Before we publiſh it to the world, we ſhould communicate it to ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wiſe, and learned perſons in the Church of God, who have the Spirit of God, and his unction as well as we. <hi>Paul,</hi> though immediately called by Chriſt, yet went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to confer with the chief pillars there, and though he was miraculouſly converted, yet he muſt go to <hi>Ananias</hi> to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directed. So, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29, 32. thoſe that had extraordinary gifts, yet were to ſubmit to the judgements of others.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, we muſt highly prize, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and delight in the known, and plain truths of Chriſt. <hi>Paul,</hi> even after he had been wrapt up into heaven, deſired to <hi>know nothing but Christ crucified. Peter</hi> thought it not inconvenient to <hi>write the ſame things</hi> they knew already. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath cauſed greater rents in the Church then an affectation of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and high things. To bring in ſome unheard, and unknowne truths. It ſhews great pride when men affect to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the authors of ſuch new noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170517:32"/>as the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> of his <hi>ſcientia media: Ego primus inveni.</hi> But to be weary of known truths, is to be weary of the ſame God, and the ſame Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Diviſions deſtroy the peace of a Kingdom. Now there is nothing that preſerves a Kingdom more then peace: The <hi>Hebrews</hi> comprehend all bleſſings under the name of <hi>Peace;</hi> Heaven it ſelf is <hi>Tranquillitas pacis.</hi> Take away peace, and you deſtroy a Kingdom.

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:170517:35"/>
               <p n="2">2. Diviſions take away the Unity of a Kingdom. Now Unity is the great preſerver of Church and State; yea, of every thing: what preſerves the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of Heaven from falling in peeces, but the Union, and Conjunction of the parts of it. The Church of Chriſt at firſt, <hi>Calente adhuc ſanguine Chriſti,</hi> as <hi>Jerom</hi> ſpeaks, whilſt the blood of Chriſt was yet warm, was at unity in it ſelf, and flouriſhed exceedingly. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46, 47.

Unity is the glew and ſoder that cements a Kingdom, or Church together: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> calls love <hi>the bond of perfection,</hi> Col. 3.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As Diviſions take away all thoſe things that are the buttereſſes to uphold a nation, ſo they open a door to all kind of miſery: they are like <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora's</hi> box, which being once opened, out-flew all kind of Sickneſſes, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where are inteſtine Diviſions, there dwells <hi>Strife, and Envy,</hi> and where
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170517:35"/>theſe are, <hi>there is Confuſion, &amp; every evil work, Jam.</hi> 3.16.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Diviſions ſet a Kingdom againſt it ſelf, and <hi>then it cannot ſtand,</hi> Mat. 12.15. they bring in Civil wars, which of all others are moſt uncivil: For,

               <p n="1">1. With humility of judgement to think that others may know the truth as well as our ſelves, to have a low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of our own underſtanding.

               <p>Seventhly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Nip diviſions in the bud, and quench the fire of contention at the beginning.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> yeeld one to another for peace ſake. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> who yeelded his right up to <hi>Lot</hi> for peace-ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.9.</p>

               <p>Tenthly, to heal our Diviſions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> we muſt make conſcience to ſilence all our private opinions, and differences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Haſt thou faith, have it to thy ſelf before God:</hi> Diſturb not the Church with thy private faith.

               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Though Chriſts people be a willing people, yet ſo far as they are Fleſh, they are weak as well as willing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. and being ſubject to ſin, they muſt be under Government too.

               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Where there are the ſame Reaſons of a practiſe, the ſame practiſe ought to continue, except it be repealed: But the ſame Reaſons remain ſtill: the Truth, and Worſhip of God ought to be as dear to Magiſtrates now, as it was then. Leaven and Corruption creep into the Church as well now as then: God is as much diſhonoured, the ſouls of men as much endangered, &amp; Satan as buſie an adverſary now as then, therefore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170517:49"/>the ſame remedies ſhould be uſed now as then.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There are Hipocrites, and <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the Church, as well as a willing people, againſt whom we find ſeverity uſed by Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles. Chriſt ſcourged the buyers, and Sellers out of the Temple, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Peter</hi> pronounced a doleful ſentence upon <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> Act. 5.4, 5, 9. which acts, though extraordinary, yet they teach us, that an Evangelical eſtate hath need as well of a Rod, as of a Spirit of meekneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Its propheſied of the times of the Goſpel, that <hi>Kings ſhall be nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing fathers to the Church. Iſa.</hi> 49.23. and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that they are for a terror to evil doers,</hi> Rom. 13.3, 4. which words reſpect good and evil in the firſt table as well as in the ſecond. We are <hi>taught to pray for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may under them lead quiet, and peaceable lives in all godlineſs, and honeſty.</hi> Now that which is the end of our prayer, is likewiſe the end of their Authority; and if it be their duty to provide for quiet, peace, and honeſty, it is to provide for godlineſs too, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 1, 2. <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170517:49"/>Juſtinian, &amp;c.</hi> are highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for making Edicts, calling Councils, prohibiting, and puniſhing Hereſies, as appears in all Authors.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Whatſoever things are in themſelves dangerous, and deſtructive to the proſperity of States, and Nations, come under the proper cognizance of the Civil Magiſtrate to prevent: But He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Blaſphemies, Idolatries, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties againſt God, do as much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a State, as ſins againſt the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God is as much provoked by the one as by the other: yea, the great ſin alledged for the captivity of <hi>Juda</hi> was, their deſpiſing Gods Meſſengers, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Becauſe ſuch ſins do more divide, and untie the bonds of love which Chriſtian Truth doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, then other civil differences, and ſo looſen the hearts of men more from one another.</p>

For Writings, &amp; words, if they be blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and ſubverſive to Church, or State, and highly derogatory to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſt, Civil reſtraint can reach them, but thoughts it cannot reach. they are unſearchable to a humane eye, and therefore unreducible to a humane

               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt did never purchaſe for any man a liberty to ſubvert, or to endeavour to ſubvert the foundations of Faith, Worſhip, and holy obedience which he hath laid in his Church by blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, heretical, Idolatrous, or wicked opinions. Gods great Truths, and the Goſpels great Intereſts ought to be dearer to us, then the liberty of any blaſphemous, or impious tongue, or pen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Magiſtrates are wiſely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between weak Brethren, and

               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> With the word, ſuch lenity, and moderation is to be uſed, as firſt to <hi>reprove, rebuke, exhort them with all long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering and Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.2.

               <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> We are to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the conſcience of the Seducer, and the ſpreading of his Doctrine: It belongs to the care of the Magiſtrate to endeavour the reclaiming of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, which if it cannot be effected, the next principal care muſt be to prevent the ſpreading of his infection.

               <p>Secondly, If we bear with ſuch, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> though we could eſcape their infection, yet we ſhall fall under the guilt of their ſins. We ſin in others while we ſuffer them to ſin; we commit all the evil which is in our power to hinder, if we hinder it not. <hi>Vitia aliorum ſi feras, facis tua.</hi> We become guilty of other mens ſins by not ſtoping, and reſtraining them; as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170517:73"/>ſhould have uſed his Authority.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If God doth not puniſh them with ſuch wicked perſons, he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally puniſheth them by them: If they be not ſcourged with them, they uſually become their ſcourges: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when for their multitude, or for fear of them, we bear with them.

               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Not to bear with ſuch evil ones is a mercy, not only to the good, but to the evil: you cannot be more cruel to them, then by ſparing them. If Magiſtrates would be friends to ſuch, they muſt not let them alone, but wound them. Its the greateſt ſtroke, when God ſtrikes not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.11. Favours, and Compliance emboldens, and hardens ſinners, whereas reproof, and puniſhments may poſſibly reform, &amp; heal them.

There is no ſtop in ſin; if they be let alone, they will grow worſe, and when they are at worſt, its worſt for themſelves. Is it not then a kindneſs to ſmite them?

               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is all love, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as well as all lovely: He is but love incarnate, and his love is made the pattern of ours: <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt hath loved us,</hi> Eph. 5.2.

He would not bear with <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his folly, but rebukes him with, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> Mat. 16.26. Chriſt in love bore all our ſins, but he will not bear with any: Let Magiſtrates not out-love their rule, and then bear as much evil as they can.</p>

It holds forth Gods good pleaſure to us, to which we muſt ſubmit, not a pattern, or rule by which we muſt walk, This is no warrant for us to let tares, and wheat to grow together, which are in our power to pluck up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt only forbids ſuch a plucking up, as by which the wheat muſt be rooted up alſo, i. e. a total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170517:75"/>For ſhould God in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant deſtroy all the wicked, the bands of humane ſociety would be diſſolved: but we know that the plucking up of many ſorts of wicked men, is a great advantage to the growth of them that are good.

               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Seeing the Command of God: the practiſe of all good Kings, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in their ſeveral places, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture, are clear for this, <hi>That evil perſons, and Hereticks muſt not be born with,</hi> as is before explained.

Or ſuch as are of Repute for piety: They have a <hi>form of godlineſs,</hi> and in their words, and deportments are <hi>transformed into Angels of light,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. As were <hi>Montanus, Novatus, Arius,</hi> and the <hi>Munſter-Anabaptiſts,</hi> who at firſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly prevailed by their diſcourſes, which were of nothing but mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, faſting, praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to more then ordinary piety, which made them to be indulged in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty differences by thoſe that were in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; pitied by the Reforming Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and followed by many pious, but inconſiderate perſons, who were ſo gulled by their ſpecious ſhews, that they little dreamed of the miſchief that ſome of their Ring-leaders aimed at.

Thus <hi>David Georg,</hi> at firſt was caſt into priſon, and bored through the tongue for ſpeaking againſt <hi>Popiſh Idolatry,</hi> which made him highly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the godly, yet afterwards he became a moſt blaſphemous <hi>Heretick,</hi> affirming that the Scriptures, even thoſe

               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Becauſe of their manner in diſperſing their <hi>Errors,</hi> they have their guiles, and Arts to inſnare poor ſouls, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. They ſtudy the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and wait their opportunities to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. <hi>They uſe fair ſpeeches to beguile the hearts of the ſimple;</hi> they profeſs Love, and Charity, to be eies to the blind, feet to the lame, guides to the erring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet they are <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening wolves,</hi> Mat. 7.15.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Becauſe of the matter which they broach, which perhaps is ſomething new, and men naturally have <hi>itching ears,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. and <hi>Athenian</hi>-like, are greedy of <hi>new things:</hi> they are weary of old truths, being they never ſaw their beauty, nor taſted their ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which if they had, they could never have ſleighted; yet many times it is not ſo much new matter, as a new dreſs in hard, and unintelligible words, which <hi>Paul</hi> counſels <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſhun, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. and hereby they conceal their meaning, leſt if it come to light, it ſhould appear what adulterate ware they obtrude upon the people for the truths of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Becauſe of the negligence
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170517:83"/>of thoſe ſervants whom Chriſt hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about his Vineyard to take care that the ſeed of Truth be ſown, and every plant of the envious mans plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be plucked up: and theſe are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Miniſters, who ſhould preach fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, hold forth the whole truth clearly, confute gain-ſayers ſolidly. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9.

               <p n="2">2. Magiſtrates, who ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and puniſh <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> as afore was ſhewed. But if the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations be removed, what can the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous do?</hi> Pſalm 11.3. O how ſad was it with the Church, when <hi>Arianiſm</hi> had invaded the Throne it ſelf: for then the people conforming to the Princes Judgement, were eaſily infected with it: Or, ſuppoſe Magiſtrates are not tainted themſelves, yet if they ſleight differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Religion, as <hi>Feſtus</hi> did the buſineſs of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 25.19, 20. Or if they be afraid to diſpleaſe, of a low ſpirit,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170517:84"/>backward to enact, and execute accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the de merit of the Error, or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> how can it be expected that either the truth ſhould be righted, or the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Hereticks</hi> repreſſed?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Becauſe peoples hearts like a prepared ſoil, are ready to intertain theſe damnable Errors: their minds are filled with darkneſs, and therefore they are unable to judge of the things of God; <hi>For they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Neither is this only natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but adventitious alſo, frequently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their frozen hearts are void of the love of the truth. But in ſome are the beginnings of knowledge, yet do they hang too equally poiſed between Truth, and Error, being full of doubts, which makes them a prey to Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: they are very credulous, like <hi>Solomons fool, Prov.</hi> 14.25. perhaps through ſluggiſhneſs, being rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take things on truſt, then to take pains to try what conformity they hold with the truth. Sometimes they have corrupt conſciences which muſt be boulſtered, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.18, 20. corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which muſt be humoured, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. and corrupt practiſes which muſt be concealed, which makes them
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170517:84"/>(like the Elephant) to muddy the pure waters of Truth, that their ugglineſs may not appear, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did the Law by their fooliſh gloſſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21, <hi>&amp;c. They love darkneſs more then light, becauſe their works are evil,</hi> John 3.19. They make their luſts their Law, and therefore lie open to be ſeduced by ſuch, who bait their hook with what is proportionable to thoſe luſts in them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Becauſe the time, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and ſeaſon much conduceth to help forward this evil. Its a time of liberty wherein the reins of Government are laid too looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the peoples neck. Nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the garb, and faſhion that is in moſt requeſt, is <hi>Hereſie,</hi> which finding pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage from perſons of no mean rank, and power, no marvel though it ſpread apace, and flouriſh; weeds appear not till the Summers-Sun revive them. So errors, if they receive not ſome gleams of countenance from ſome in a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or orb, would ſoon wither, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Firſt, Becauſe the Scripture doth flatly charge ſin, and perniciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and damnation upon them. <hi>Hereſie</hi> is made a <hi>work of the fleſh</hi> that excludes men from the <hi>kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Gal. 5.20, 21. <hi>Peter</hi> calls them <hi>pernicious, and damnable, that bring ſwift deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> and ſaith of the Authors of them, <hi>that their damnation ſlumbers not,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Let us conſider unto what dangerous things <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and Errors are compared in Scripture, by what dangerous Creatures, <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and falſe Teachers are expreſſed. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereſies</hi> are compared to a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,</hi> or <hi>Canker,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. which corrupts one part after another, till at length it eats out the very heart, and life. Sometimes to a <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. In what a miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are paſſengers, when their ſhip is ſplit under them? Chriſt calls them <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Paul</hi> calls them a <hi>bewitching.</hi> Learned Writers call them a <hi>Leproſie, Poiſon, Fire, a Tempeſt, a flood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereticks are ſometimes ſtiled <hi>Foxes, Cant.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Dogs, rending Dogs, Phil.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Wolves, grievous Wolves which devour the flock,</hi> Act. 20.29.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170517:85"/>Sometimes in effect they are called <hi>Mountebanks, Cheaters, and ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile unstable ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt and his Apoſtles give ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al charges, and caveats againſt them, which they would not have done, had they not been very dangerous. <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Phariſees.</hi> Mat. 7.15. <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you; for many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many.</hi> Phil. 3.2. <hi>Beware of dogs,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Beware lest being led aſide by the error of the wicked ye fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The danger of them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great. <hi>Hereſies</hi> are the greateſt, and higheſt of dangers to the Church of Chriſt, worſe then the ſword, priſon, exile, ſpoiling, torments, yea, and the cruelleſt death. For the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes gained by theſe, grew more in Purity, in Unity, in Zeal, and Courage: not ſo by <hi>Hereſies:</hi> which are a <hi>flood</hi> caſt out of the mouth of the <hi>Serpent, Rev.</hi> 12.15. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are a corrupting, and defiling flood, they defile the pure waters, ſpoil the ground, leave filth, and mud behind them; and coming out of the mouth
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170517:86"/>of the Serpent, they are poiſonous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and there are four precious things which <hi>Hereſies corrupt,</hi> and defile.
<list>
                     <item>1. Souls of men, which is the nobleſt, and choieſt thing in man, of more value then all the world. <hi>Damnable Hereſies makes us deny the Lord that bought us,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1.</item>
                     <item>2. The leading faculty of the ſoul. It caſts poiſon into the ſpring. <hi>Hereſies</hi> corrupt the Judgement which moves all the other faculties of the ſoul. <hi>If the light which is in you be darkneſs, how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> If the Judgement be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, how dangerous is that infection? In how deſperate a condition is the whole ſoul of ſuch an one? If it recover not out of its <hi>Errors,</hi> it dies for it.</item>
                     <item>3. The moſt active faculty of the ſoul: they defile, and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> the Conſcience: Now this is amazingly dangerous. A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Error</hi> is blinding when it is in the Judgement only: but its binding alſo when it is in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170517:86"/>Conſcience; For whatſoever engages Conſcience, the ſame engageth all, and the utmoſt of our all. If Conſcience be made a party againſt the Truth, now all that a man hath, all that he can do, will be made out againſt the truth too. Such an one (with <hi>Paul)</hi> will grow <hi>mad,</hi> and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate againſt. Chriſt. <hi>Pauls</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conſcience made him conſent to <hi>Stevens</hi> death; yea, could he, in that condition, have met with Chriſt himſelf; he would have done the like againſt him.</item>
                     <item>4. The Converſations of men. <hi>Hereſie</hi> is ſeldom, or never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from impiety. Such make <hi>Shipwrack of a good conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19. whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Dogs,</hi> he calls alſo <hi>Evil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> Phil. 3.2. and Tit. 1.15, 16. ſpeaking of ſome whoſe minds were defiled, he adds that they were <hi>reprobate to every good work:</hi> And Chriſt ſpeaking of falſe Prophets, ſaith, <hi>You may know them by their fruits.</hi> The Doctrine of faith is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170517:87"/>of Holineſs; and a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of lies, is a Doctrine of prophaneſs too. He that falls from truth to falſhood, will quickly fall from piety to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. <hi>Sleiden</hi> in his ſtory of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> writes, that <hi>Errors</hi> began in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ended with wicked practiſes. <hi>Cyprian</hi> writing of <hi>Novatus,</hi> ſaith, that he was one who itched after new notions, and was beyond meaſure cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, intolerably proud: no man ſo prying, no man ſo treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: he would commend you to your face, and cut your throat behind your back: as falſe a perſon as lived; a very fire-brand; and turned the world up ſide down that he might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his opinion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hereſies</hi> are a drowning, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing flood: Now there are three things that <hi>Hereſies</hi> overwhelm.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The glory of all glories; the glorious name of God, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name of Chriſt, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of the Holy Spirit, the glorious name of divine truths
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170517:87"/>
                     <hi>Hereſie</hi> turns the glory into a lie; It gives God, Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt the lye: Truth the lye, the Scripture the lye: and he that makes the word of God a Lyer, makes God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Lyer.</item>
                  <item>2. The Glory of Religion. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is darkened: It grows baſe, and beggerly when its patched with <hi>Errors.</hi> All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is by ſo much the more excellent, by how much the more of truth it hath, but when once its adulterated, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with damnable <hi>Errors,</hi> now the ſilver is become droſs; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Not only the dignity, but the very vital entity of a Church. Truth is the ſoul of that body, and <hi>Error</hi> is the death of it. <hi>Schiſm</hi> doth much hurt: but falſe Doctrines more. <hi>Schiſms</hi> do rent the coat, but <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> do rent the heart: thoſe pluck up the fence, but theſe pluck down the building; thoſe do ſcratch, but theſe do kill.</item>

               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:170517:88"/>

Though truth gets on very ſlowly, becauſe of the incapacity of mans Judgment for ſupernaturalls, becauſe of that naturall oppoſition in man to the things of God, becauſe of the ſubtile interpoſition of the Prince of darkeneſſe, who blindes the minds of men, <hi>Leſt the light of the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

There needs no preparation of the ground for net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: If the ſeeds do but drop downe, you may ſoone have a full crop. How ſoone doth a litle leaven, <hi>leaven the whole lump. Paul</hi> wondered that the <hi>Galatians</hi> were <hi>ſo ſoone turned to another Goſpel. Gal.</hi> 1.6.

               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>Hereſies</hi> are an encreaſing, and ſwelling floud. Falſe Doctrines at firſt, ſeem to be modeſt: they will be but ſcruples, and <hi>quaere's:</hi> and then they

If you conſult <hi>Hiſtoricall Antiquity,</hi> its a wonder to behold the great flames that were kindled out of ſmall ſparks: what monſtrous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been built upon errors, which ſeemed but little at firſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>Hereſies</hi> are more dangerous then any other floud by reaſon of their diverſe qualities in them. Other flouds are quickly up, and quickly down: theſe are quickly up, but abate very ſlowly: they are like diſeaſes, they come upon us flying, but goe from us creeping.

It's raſh zeal, zeal without knowledge to do any thing this way, without the bounds of ones particular calling, in the limits whereof every one ſhould abide with God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20, 24.

That this is a charge of Chriſt, as Mediatour, to all ſuch as being in place and office under him, are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and puniſh, even by the temporal ſword, as our Civil Rulers, who in a Politicall way are herein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned forcibly to take ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters, and diſturbers of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as well as of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuch taking of <hi>Foxes</hi> is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170517:113"/>very acceptable to Chriſt, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and Political head of the Church: yea, and to the bleſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Spirit, in whoſe name its done, and to the Church, in whoſe behalf it is done. So <hi>Num.</hi> 25.11. with 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, God ſaith, that <hi>Phineas</hi> his act of zeal, was for his ſake, <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>The Kings, and Judges of the earth are required to ſerve the Lords anointed,</hi> verſe 6. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken to Kings, cannot be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſervice which other godly perſons performe, but extends to authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſervice, as Civil Rulers: and this was no <hi>Moſaical</hi> injunction that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned only <hi>Judahs Kings:</hi> but the <hi>Pſalm</hi> being Prophetical of Goſpel-times, ſhews that its a command lying upon <hi>Gentile-Rulers,</hi> to ſerve Chriſt with their Authority in reſtraining, and puniſhing corruptions in Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Reaſon is taken from the end to which the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is appointed by God, whether that end be more general, or ſpecial.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In General, he is appointed for the good of his Subjects, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. whether that good be natural, as ſafety of their bodies, life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or moral, as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170517:113"/>Temperance, Chaſtity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Civil, as Civil liberties, mens Lands, Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or ſpiritual, as the free paſſage of the Goſpel, the purity of Worſhip, and of the Doctrine, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if God hath made him a Miniſter for good all theſe ways, then he hath armed him with power in a Civil way to promote that good of his Subjects, and to reſcue them from whatſoever breaks out to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that good: And truly corruptions in matters of Religion do ſtrike at all that good, both as they provoke God in Judgment to blaſt al that good to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where they do prevail; &amp; as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion breaches in a State to the prejudice of their liberties, and peace: witneſſe the ſad fruits of Popery, formerly amongſt us. Of <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> and of <hi>Levelliſme</hi> not long ſince in <hi>England,</hi> and I pray God that theſe may be the laſt, and to divert that ſtorm which ſeems to approach by reaſon of many turbulent, and ſeditious ſpirits now working amongſt us: and is not then the Magiſtrate, who in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is appointed for the ſpiritual good of his Subjects, to maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them by oppoſing, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170517:114"/>all principles, and practiſes which tend to the diſturbance of the Church. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>What need the Church any ſuch helps? It carried on Church-wayes, and worſhip, when the Rulers of the earth hindred it: and it hath weapons of its own to avenge all diſobedience?</hi> 2 Cor. 10.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Its true, this help of Civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not of abſolute neceſſity to the being of a Church; but its an acumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative good, conferred by God upon the Church to curb, and hinder whatſoever is deſtructive to her good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Church hath uſed her power againſt the diſturbers of her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and peace; yet even then they may, and uſually do grow more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and turbulent, and do more hurt then they did before: yea, ſuch may go from place to place to make proſelytes; So that either the Magiſtrates ſword, and ſervice is needful, or there will be left no ordinary, nor orderly power to reſtrain, and puniſh ſuch groſſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a third reaſon is from the prayers which God commands his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make for this end: and the praiſes
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170517:114"/>which they return to God when ſuch an end is attained.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For prayers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. I exhort that prayers, &amp;c. be made for Kings, &amp;c. that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe, and honeſty. Whence it follows.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That we come not to God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be let alone by authority in any way that is contrary to godlineſſe or honeſty; the contrary deſire being that which we are taught here to pray for.</item>
                  <item>2. That Magiſtrates by their office, now under the New Teſtament, are to look to matters that pertaine to godlineſs, both Doctrinal, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, appearing in outward view, as well as to matters of honeſty.</item>
                  <item>3. If this be a prayer according to the will of God, as it muſt needs be, being directed by the Holy Ghoſt, then its Gods will that Magiſtrates ſhould by their authority ſee that their ſubjects lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe, and honeſty, that is free from diſturbance in any ſuch wayes of godlineſſe, by open, and manifeſt diſturbers thereof.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="2">2. For praiſes. So in <hi>Ezra's</hi> dayes:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170517:115"/>they thankfully acknowledged it as put into the hearts of their rulers by God, to take ſuch effectual care of pure, peaceable, and comfortably carrying on the whole work of God committed to them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.25, &amp;c. So <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15. they praiſe God, for that the <hi>Kingdomes of the earth are become the Kingdomes of Christ,</hi> and for that he <hi>takes to himſelf the Kingdome.</hi> Now the Kingdoms of the earth become Chriſts, not onely when the people ſubmit to Chriſts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but when ſuch as Rule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt, do rule for him, and by their civil power, ſuppreſſe ſuch as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe, or ſeek to ſubvert, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his royal Laws, and bleſſed inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions held forth in his Word.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> another argument may be taken from the zeal foretold to be in private Chriſtians in Goſpel-times, whereby they ſhould provoke civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to uſe the ſword in puniſhing perſons groſly guilty of corruptions in Religion: ſo in that propheſie before ſpoken of, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.3, 6.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Another reaſon is taken from the publick evil removed, and good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the due uſe of ſuch power, and the ſad miſchiefs attending, either the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170517:115"/>want, or groſſe neglect thereof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2, 3, 5, 7. when Idolaters are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſtoned, its added, <hi>ſo ſhalt thou put away the evill from amongst you:</hi> Good alſo is attained, and that, 1. Moral, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.10. <hi>All Iſrael ſhall hear, and fear, and do no more ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe.</hi> 2. Civil, in regard of their outward eſtate; God would then bleſs them with peace and plenty: when the Idolaters were puniſhed, God <hi>ſent raine,</hi> 1 King. 18.40, 41. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.3, 4, 5. Conſider alſo what a deluge of evils enſue when ſuch power is wanting, or not executed. Thence idolatry, <hi>Jude</hi> 17.4, 5, 6. Thence corruption in Church Diſcipline, <hi>v.</hi> 12. with <hi>ch.</hi> 18.1. yea, it lets in all temporal judgements: when there is none to ſtand in the gap, and authoritatively to make up the hedge which is broken down by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gods worſhip, then an inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ruining judgements follows, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.25, 26. with <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. and as it is miſchievous to the Church and State, ſo to the negligent rulers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to their families: It was the ruine of <hi>Eli's</hi> houſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22, 23, 24. with 27.28, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> when Magiſtrates want zeal
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170517:116"/>to reſtraine, and puniſh <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and corrupters of his Word, and worſhip, God ſtirs up zeal in others in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way to do it. When <hi>Ahab</hi> would not, <hi>Elijah</hi> doth it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. he will have it ſome way done, and therefore he likes of it.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170517:116"/>avoid, and will this make them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Such coercive power in matters of Religion is the way to bring in perſecution for conſcience ſake?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Teaching Magiſtrates their duty to puniſh things manifeſtly croſs to the Word of God, and that after due means uſed for conviction, is rather a way to reſtraine them from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Saints for a good cauſe, or conſcience, and if accidentally Gods enemies take occaſion hence to abuſe their power, this muſt not take away the due uſe of it. <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> abuſed Church-cenſures againſt the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet this their ſin diſchargeth not the Church from its duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its an abſurd argument to reaſon thus. Men may not be perſecuted for a good cauſe, and conſcience; therefore they may not be puniſhed for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bad cauſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The exerciſe of any ſuch power by godly Rulers is croſſe to the meek Spirit of Chriſt, and to that merciful ſpirit which he requires to be in his Saints?</hi> Rom. 15.1. Gal. 6.1, 2. Eph. 4.32. 2 Tim. 2.25.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that liberty which ſuffers men ordinarily to draw perſons away
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170517:117"/>from God is not to be granted by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates; but to tollerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, under a pretence of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, pertinaciouſly to hold forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt opinions, is to ſuffer them to draw others from God, therefore its not to be allowed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.9.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſuch a liberty carries a brand of <hi>Anarchy</hi> in the State, yea, and of a ſad judgement of God upon that State for the provoking ſins both of rulers and people. 1. Its one brand of <hi>Anarchy,</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:170517:118"/>Judg. 17.6. <hi>there was no King in Iſrael, every one did what was right in his own eyes.</hi> 2.

               <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſuch a tolleration makes Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers not to be for Chriſt, but in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, againſt him: for it makes them not to be for one chief end of his coming, which was <hi>to deſtroy the works of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> For a tolleration of errours is a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating the works of the devil; becauſe erroneous doctrines are forged by the devil, and are ſome of thoſe lies whereof he is the Father, <hi>John</hi> 8.44.

               <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Such a Tolleration will wound a State in the very continuity of it: It breaks the hedge, and walls of a State; and ſo lets in manifold miſchiefs: For,</p>
